Program Counter.

The Program Counter consists of a 16-bit serial-in, parallel out shift register, a half adder, an 2-input multiplexer and a carry flipflop. However the design is somewhat convoluted and spread across 6 ICs.

The following notes explain the design, and a simulation of the Program Counter circuit is available on the github repo.

U2 and U3 (74HC595) form the 16-bit Program Counter.

Output pins

15		RMA15 (MSB)
1		RMA14
2		RMA13
3		RMA12
4		RMA11
5		RMA10
6		RMA9
7		RMA8  (LSB)

9		Serial Output to lower stage
10		/CLR	Active LOW reset signal - check it goes low when RESET switch pressed
11		PC_CLK  16-clock pulse burst - check for continuous clocking
12		Outout Latch clock pulse - low going pulse, every 16th clock
13      /PC_EN  Active LOW enable pin - should remain LOW
14      PC_IN  Serial Input 

8		GND
16 		3V3

The Program Counter is connected to U12, U14 U15 and U16.

U12 (74HC86) provides inversion of the !JMP signal.

The left hand side of U14 (74HC283) provides a half adder to increment the PC by one, once per machine cycle (20 clocks).

The right hand side of  U15 (74HC126) provides a 2-input multiplexer. The PC is either loaded with the current count, or if !JMP is LOW it is loaded with the value in the B-Register.

U16 (74HC74) is a dual flipflop. The right-hand flipflop is used to hold any carry produced when adding 1 to the PC and adding it into the next half sum.
